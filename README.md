Cordial greetings.

This is a template to do data analysis for TSO Mobile company.
Folder data is for raw data storage. Module 2 only works with data placed in this folder.
Folder reports is for save files created by program. 
Folder charts is for charts saving.
To use "Tables comparator" module, option 3, tables must be processed by "Units report" module, option 2 before.
Charts module is designed to do charts time/count. First, pass the table to graph by "Str_date_ord" module, option 7
to standarize date format. After that, select "Table_info" module, option 5. Finally, select "Charts" module option8.
To save graphs, use charts folder.
Charts module only was tested with "1 table option". It must be tested more times.

Best regards:
Jose.
