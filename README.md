Cordial greetings.

This is a template to do data analysis for TSO Mobile company.
Folder data is for raw data storage.
Folder reports is for save files created by program. 
Folder charts is for charts saving. I have not done trials with charts yet.
To use "Tables comparator" module, tables must be processed by "Units report" module before.
